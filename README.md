      </body>
      <script src="./modal.js"></script>
      

That's it! Your modal window should work like a breeze now.

### How to modify modal.js HTML and animations after downloading

Now, theres an interesting but common case, you've downloaded the
`modal.js` file, but after downloading the file, you've found to modify
either the HTML being rendered inside the modal or the style of modal
itself.

-   Open `modal.js` file that you've downloaded.
-   Search for `document.body.innerHTML` in `modal.js file.`
-   You'll come along with following code snippet:

<!-- -->

      ...
      //HTML inside the modal and Input CSS animation tag
      document.body.innerHTML += 
        `<div class="modal" id="myModal">
          <div class="modal-content-area animated shake">
            <i class="close-button" aria-hidden="true">âœ–</i>
            
              <h1>Hello world</h1>
              <p>It's shahzaib here.</p>
              <p>Download resume</p>
            
            
          </div>
        </div>`;
      //Output CSS animation name              
      classesToHide = ['modal-content-area', 'animated', 'wobble'];
      //Input CSS animation tag
      classesToRetainOriginal = ['modal-content-area', 'animated', 'shake'];
      ...
      

-   Modal HTML code and both, input, output animation tags are
    highlighted in above code.
-   `shake` is input animation, while `wobble` is output animation.
-   You can make these changes in `modal.js` file to change animations
    and HTML content of modal window.

### How to modify modal.js styling after downloading

Now, after HTML content and animations, next thing to modify is CSS
styling of modal window and the HTML content within modal window.

-   Open `modal.js` file.
-   Search for `$modalCSS` first occurance in file.
-   Here's how the code looks like:

<!-- -->

      ...
      $outputAnimation: 'wobble',
      $modalCSS: `.modal {
        display: none;
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
        overflow:auto;
      }
      ...
      

That's it. Now, you can add or remove CSS style tags here and thus
modify modal window styling.

### What if I want to add more than one modal window on same page?

That's complicated! But there's a workaround.

-   Finalize your 2nd modal and download `modal.js` file.
-   Now go into file and find and replace all JavaScript variables,
    function names, e.g. replace `openModal()` with something like
    `openModalSecond()`.
-   Replace Style classes of only modal related CSS, e.g. replace
    `.modal` with `.modalSecond`.
-   Through this way, you can add as many distinct modal windows as you
    want and trigger them using their respective triggering functions.
